# Day 3
## Ethical AI or Explainable AI (xAI by Google)

.._AI is often seen as a black box and the method of obtaining the outputs is not always explainable._


.. DL models use millions of parameters and create extremely complex and highly nonlinear internal representations of the images or datasets that are fed to them.

.. Google having a mission of being AI-first has launched xAI for better understanding and transparency of the DL models

#### Major concerns
Need to understand the AI and build trust.  
Post-prediction justification is not a correct approach.   
Explainability goals should be built into the AI model/system at the core design stage and should be an integral part of the system rather than an attachment.

> DARPA (US defence dept) has built a separate program in xAI for future AI/ML-driven defense systems.

_“Explainable AI is a set of tools and frameworks to help you develop interpretable and inclusive machine learning models and deploy them with confidence.  
With it, you can understand feature attributions in AutoML Tables and AI Platform and visually investigate model behavior using the What-If Tool.”_

> New technologies such as AI and ML have opened the field up to the Cloud service players for novel themes, strategies, and approaches to try on.

xAI is on Google Computing Platform, which is a step in providing explainability of the complex neural networks employed for highly accurate results.

1. **Model_Cards** to show the features used in each model along with the user friendly guide to the model.
2. **What_If_Tool** integrated with Explanable AI to investigate model performance on custom scenarios, optimization techniques and even individual data manipulations.
3. **AI_Explanations** : get a score explaining how each factor contributed to the final result of the model predictions. 

.. The issue of Bias and Fairness; descriminations against certain groups due to limitations of the datasets fed to the model.
.. External Automated Audit; some have proposed automated, scalable, external audit systems to be managing the decisions coming out of black-box AI platforms.
