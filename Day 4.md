# Day 4
## MLFlow
It's an open source framework for operational flow of ML models. It includes experimentation, model development and scalable deployment in the cloud. It it an extensive framework and is used by major corporations.

`pip install mlflow`

## Graffitist
It's an approach towards quantization of ML models without much decrease in accuracy. It uses the technique of Training Quantization thresholds (TQT) using standard backpropagation and gradient descent.
> It has reached max ~70% accuracy on ImageNet data.

## Quantum Computing and Neural Networks
Quantum computers (QC) have dynamic bits called qubits (super-position of 0 and 1) contrary to traditional computing with static bits (0 and 1). This increases the computational power manifold and is the reason for the computational supremacy of QCs
The biggest QC made is of 53 qubits by Google and IBM separately. 
> The QCs are currently not more than research fields because of the noise and errors encountered in the hardware due to entanglement and superposition.
