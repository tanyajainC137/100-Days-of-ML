# Day 7
## Web Deployment using Flask
> I need to break away from core ML for a while because I need to implement/showcase an analytics project I did some back as a web app for my college presentation. Nevertheless, I'll keep logging in the gained knowledge here!

### **Flask** is a microframework in python which is helpful in deploying web apps and writing frontend in Python.  
* Other Alternatives include Django and Angular.js
* It is used in integration with HTML and CSS which provides easy structure and style to web pages.
* Create a folder 'templates' in your project folder and add all the html and css files in it. These can be access by using the module `render_template` from flask. 
* Flask acts as an intermediary between frontend user input/navigation and the respective HTML webpages responses.
* **Bootstrap** is another technique used by programmers to use pre-defined templates of certain structure and style for quick fixes in the web-apps. The documentation on [get.bootstrap.com](https:\\get.bootstrap.com) is a good place to start experimenting with HTML tags. 

`pip install flask`

* After working around on the flask app and getting the hang of it I was able to create a good looking header on various different webpages
